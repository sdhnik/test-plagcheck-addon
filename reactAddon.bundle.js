activity on clothes trading in retail stores;\n·   \tDirectors of stores are granted with Power of Attorney (hereinafter – the “PoA”) to sign documents related to commercial activity of the LLC;\n·   \tThe LLC needs legal advice on the possibility to:\nØ  delegate the Director’s signature right of HR documents to the directors of stores on a regular basis under the separate PoAs which will be issued for these purposes;\nØ  delegate Director’s signature right of all documents used in the economic activity of the LLC to the Administrative Director of LLC on the basis of the relevant PoA, thus having two signatories in the LLC with the same scope of authorities.  \n \nIf any of the above facts and assumptions is incorrect, we kindly ask you to notify us immediately as it may influence the scope of our services.\n \nDocuments provided for the analysis\n \n·   \tArticles of Association approved by the Minutes of General Meeting No. 36 as of 13 January 2017 (hereinafter – the “AoA”);\n·   \tOrders of appointment of the Director and Administrative director.\n \nSummary of conclusions\n \n·   \tDirector of the LLC is entitled to delegate the right to sign HR documents to directors of stores, provided such right is envisaged by the AoA. If such right is not established by the AoA, this might trigger the risks of liability in accordance with the current legislation\n·   \tDelegation of Director’s signatory rights in full and on regular basis to the Administrative director is not in compliance with the corporate documents of the LLC and might bear the risk of such documents invalidation being signed by unauthorized signatory.\n·   \tThe AoA of the LLC needs introduction of relevant amendments:\nØ  competence of the Director to delegate his signature right of HR documents to a certain category of employees/representatives\nØ  competence of the Administrative director in the AoA with the relevant registration in the Uniform state register of legal entities, individual entrepreneurs and public organizations as an official signatory of behalf of the LLC.\n \nOur analysis\n \nWe have based our analysis on provided documents, current Ukrainian legislation, our professional experience and relevant business practice.\nI.           Delegation of the authority to sign HR documents to the directors of stores\nUnder Ukrainian legislation managing bodies of the LLC are General Meeting of company’s participants (hereinafter – the “GM”) and executive body of the LLC [1].\nThe GM appoints the executive body and defines its powers [2].\nExecutive body of the LLC solves all issues related to the company’s business activity, acts on behalf of the company within the limits established by legislation and the founding documents [3]. Under the provided AoA Director is the sole executive body of the LLC. Along with other authorities, Director is authorized to make decisions on hiring, dismissal and professional training of the employees.  Director is authorized to issue PoAs to take legal actions on behalf of the LLC.\nWe see no direct prohibitions based on the legislation and the AoA to delegate the stated authorities to the directors of stores on the basis of the relevant PoAs.\nHowever, being not clearly defined, the legal actions as prescribed by the AoA may be interpreted as signing the documents on behalf of the LLC in relations with the third parties within the economic activity of the LLC, excluding the right to sign the documents of administrative character aimed at hiring, dismissal and professional training of the employees.\nIn usual business practice, signing HR documents is the prerogative of the executive body. However, as the business practice of our clients – large retailers shows, both variants are used - delegating power of attorney to sign the HR documents, signing the documents by the executive authority (no delegation takes place).\nBeing not directly envisaged in the AoA, delegating the right to sign the HR documents may trigger the following risks:\nü A court dispute proceeding may by triggered by the employee based on the ground of dismissal documents signing by an unauthorized person of LLC. It may result to a final court decision on returning employee to the work.\nü Administrative fines may be imposed to the LLC for violation of labor legislation in the amount of one minimum wage for one violation detection [4] or to the Director in the amount of app. UAH 510 to 1 700 [5].\nü Bringing Director to criminal responsibility for the severe violation of the labor legislation in form of fine imposition in the amount app. 850 UAH or deprivation of right to hold specific posts or be engaged in certain activities up to 5 years or detention up to 6 months or restraint up to 2 years [6].\n \nOur recommendations\nTo avoid occurrence of the mentioned above risks, we recommend to introduce the relevant amendments to the AoA allowing the Director to delegate his authorities on signing the HR documents to clearly defined categories of employees/representatives.\nTo be absolutely compliant with the provisions of the legislation, such signatories (directors of stores) should also be registered with the Uniform state register of legal entities, individual entrepreneurs and public organizations. We understand that from the practical point of view, such registration is very complicated for the companies, and in practice signatories of such documents are not included into the Register.\nII.     \tDelegation of authority to sign all documents used in the economic activity of the LLC to the Administrative Director of LLC on the basis of the relevant PoA\n \nThe powers and competence of the Administrative Director are not defined by current AoA.\n \nAs was mentioned earlier, the competence of the Director is established by the GM. Delegation of the established competence to another authority on a regular basis needs the relevant approval of GM, introduction the relevant amendments to the AoA with further registration of the new signatory with the Uniform State register of legal entities, individual entrepreneurs and public organizations [7].\n \nTherefore, we understand that the delegation Director’s signatory rights in full and on regular basis is not in compliance with the corporate documents of the LLC and might bear the risk of such documents invalidation being signed by unauthorized signatory.\nMoreover, the official position of the State Fiscal Service of Ukraine [8] is that the exercise of powers by the Representative based on the PoA/Order granted by the Director can be recognized only on a temporary basis (for a period of Director’s absence, i.e., temporary disability, business trip, vacations, etc.).\nConsidering the all mentioned above, there is a risk that documents that are signed on the basis of regular PoA may be not recognized by the state authorities, in particular.  \n \nOur recommendations\nTo mitigate the mentioned above risks we recommend to introduce the relevant amendments to the AoA on the competence of the Administrative Director and to register the Administrative director as LLC’s signatory with the Uniform State
